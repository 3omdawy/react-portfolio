# React demo portfolio
Capstone project for Meta Advanced React course: portfolio page with top navbar and footer + 3 sections (hero - projects - contact me)

## Output
1. Top navbar and hero section
![Hero](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91c3c024-a33d-4a30-947b-7a4873fec2db)

2. Projects section
![Projects](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da5323b-b9ab-4f36-9a14-06f806693ad1)

3. Contact section and footer
![Contact](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b12b6b6-a08e-4dac-b4e3-dcd0c2a5a746)

## Technical Highlights
* Navbar containing external and internal links (with smooth scrolling). It disappears on scrolldown event and reappears on scrollup event
* UI is done with Chakra UI (not responsive on all devices, runs well on large screens only)
* Form and its validation are done with Formik and Yup

## Steps
```
git clone https://github.com/3omdawy/react-portfolio.git
cd react-portfolio
npm install
npm start
```
